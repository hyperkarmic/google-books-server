## Project Title
Biblio-Graphy (Server)

## Motivation
I'm quite forgetful!  I want to remember books that I have read recently, and books that I'd like to read in the near future!

This is an application that allows me to search for a book by title or keyword, returning author and a front cover picture.  Books can then be saved to a database.  Extra information can be acquired by clicking on a button.  A book can be deleted by clicking on a different button.


## Build Status

Fully Functional.

## Installation
Down load or clone from  https://github.com/hyperkarmic/google-books-server.   Run npm install in the root directory after cloning/downloading to ensure dependencies are installed.

## How to use
run 'npm run start' in a terminal located in the root directory.  A message will come back confirming the server is running.  The endpoints outlined in the api.js file can be then used to get, post or delete information in the database!
